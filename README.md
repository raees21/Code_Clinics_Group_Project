# Code_Clinics_Group_Project


The booking system will be implemented as a set of command-line tools that can run on any campus workstation.

Run on the Linux version that you are using on campus
Take command-line arguments as input
It must have a help command that describes the command-line arguments
It must provide output either to a file and/or to standard output, so that it can be used by another command-line tool in the system
If providing output via standard output, it means the output can also be piped to a file using the linux pipe operators
You can choose in what data format you will store any internal data, e.g. json, xml, or something else entirely.
